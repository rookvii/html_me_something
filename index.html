            <p>Japanese role-play games, or <abbr>JRPG</abbr>s, will always have a special place in my heart. While EarthBound wasn't my first <abbr>JRPG</abbr>, it had more impact than most games at the time. I bought a copy for $2 from a friend at school who didn't like the game, and still own that same copy today almost 20 years later. Granted the cartridge doesn't play anymore, but I have the fondest memories spending time with my younger brothers taking turns fighting monsters and exploring dungeons while trying to save the world.</p>

            <div>
              <p>Lara Croft is probably the most iconic female video game influence of my childhood. Before JRPGs ruled my life, Tomb Raider kept me up shooting baddies in the jungle and hunting for ancient artifacts and relics. It was my first time playing a fully self-sufficient heroine who relied on her own skill and knowledge to complete her goals, and she was everything my tiny child-heart wanted in an action hero.</p>

              <p><b>*spoiler alert*</b> Aerith Gainsborough's death is the first time a video game ever made me cry. I still remember sitting at my best friend's house while watching her play, only to see my favorite flower girl get stabbed through the back with a sword longer than I am tall.</p>

              <p>My favorite time of the weekend growing up was after church, when we'd go back to my friend Helen's house and play video games all afternoon. <b>*spoiler alert*</b> Sheik, a mysterious male-presenting character who appears to the protagnoist Link to teach him warping songs on his ocarina, turns out to be the Princess Zelda that Link is trying to help. <em>Surprise, surprise!</em> This tidbit of information isn't discovered until the end of the game and had me mind-blown for days.</p>

            <div>
              <p>I basically wanted to go to a SeeD academy instead of regular high school, because fighting monsters seemed a whole heck of a lot cooler than anywhere I'd previously attended. Rinoa Heartilly, one of the female protagonists, begins the game physically weak but determined and ambitious. As the story progresses she grows, both in strength and courage, and by the end of the game on my many playthroughs she could literally carry my entire team of characters.</p>
              <P>Aside from <abbr>JRPG</abbr>s, I never saw Asian female characters protrayed as anything but one-dimensional, submissive, and weak; seeing a female-identifying character who looks like me be more than just a backdrop was a huge deal and left an impression that keeps me going back and playing through again, 20 years later.</p>

            <div>
              <p>Quina Quen is from a race that is genderless, and thus goes through the entire game switching between male and female pronouns as it makes no difference to them. This never seemed an odd concept to me; I'm half-Korean and Asian cultures treat gender differently than Western culture.</p>
              <p>There is a part of the game where Quina (genderless) and Vivi (male) need to be wed in order to proceed and so without hesitation, you're able to get married and go about your merry way. While the developers never commented officially on whether or not the side quest was intended to be progressive or simply a joke, after many years of playing the series I always felt pretty confident in the assumption that the inclusion of a genderless race helped round out the game's numerous and diverse character lineup.</p>

            <div>
              <p>After watching every 15-year-old guy I knew lose their mind over a first person shooter (<abbr>FPS</abbr>), I had no interest in playing Halo. Games with guns were great and all, but I was over the run-and-gun mentality that games like Call of Duty and Battlefield had as it didn't require a whole lot of thinking on my part. Then Halo happened, and my world shifted into a nonsensical mess of aliens, sticky grenades that glow, and a very opinionated A.I. that ruled my life. I started playing locally with friends and hosted <abbr>LAN</abbr> parties, and eventually the series added online play. The series also spawned an internet-famous web series called Red vs Blue. Even now, Microsoft uses Cortana's voice and name as their version of Siri, speaking volumes to the importance of the series in not only gaming culture, but tech culture.</p>

            <div>
              <p>For as long as I can remember, I've enjoyed horror movies and games. I love being scared, and eventually began seeking out games to complement the horrific Japanese and Korean horror movies I convinced my mother to let me rent from Blockbuster&reg;. Enter the Fatal Frame series, with 17-year-old Miku Hinasaki weilding only a camera, known as the <em>Camera Obscura,</em> and her wits to face off against some seriously heinous spirits within Himuro Mansion.</p>

            <div>
              <p>Honestly, Tom Nook controlled my life and I may never buy a home because of it. <em>I jest, I jest!</em> Tom Nook is a tanuki, which is an animal that resembles a racoon but is, in fact, a canid. His role in the game is to help guide you while also pressuring you to either pay off your mortgage, or upgrade your house. Just like... real life.</p>
